# Excel-Training
This repo is a documentary for my excel training throughout the week of August 7th to August 12th, 2023

This is the youtube link I used as a guide for my learning https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl0H-qTclOg
This video has six projects to complete: 
  Payroll
  Gradebook
  Decision Factors
  Sales Database
  Car Inventory
  Problem solving 
From this project examples, I have learnt how to carry out series of excel functions like using VLOOKUP appropriately, using the MID and LEFT functions to pick letters/number from a particular cell, using CONCATANATE to join values from different cells together. Also, I learnt how to import data from CSV and transform it to be suit what I need it for.
Pivot table and charts is also an important aspect of this training.  
AS a Data analyst, communicating your findings in a easier way in which the stakeholders can understand is very important to the success of our work.
